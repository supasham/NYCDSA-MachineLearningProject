# NYCDSA-MachineLearningProject
Third project involving application of machine learning techniques to Ames housing data to predict sales prices. 

This project is submitted as project requirement for NYCDSA Machine Learning project. It is based on data from the famous Ames Housing Kaggle competition. It showcases various ML algorithms applied to the data for predictive modelling purposes of house sale price.

My aim is to showcase the data science lifecycle for this project from start to finish. Due to time constraints, I have concluded with insights into the different ML models but would have liked to have taken this further (by showcasing predictive insights and creating an interactive dashboard).

I hope you find the project interesting, useful and accurate. I also hope you enjoy it as much as I did in producing it.


Instructions for use:
1) Load Jupyter notebook for complete analysis
2) Peruse powerpoint presentation for summary of work and insights.
